# ITSC-prediction
# Project Name: Trajectory Prediction

To provide a clearer and more intuitive representation of the predictive uncertainty, the confidence intervals are rendered at every fourth trajectory point, starting from the first predicted step. This sampling strategy effectively illustrates the evolution of the prediction error bounds while maintaining visual clarity in the dynamic trajectory display. Here are the animated demonstrations:
